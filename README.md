# amplitude-circular-visualization-demo
This is just a demo repo for cicular visualization which I built for AmplitudeJs.

Note that the original visualization was made by  [@DavidLazic](https://github.com/DavidLazic/audio-visualizer) I'v just make my adjustments to adabt it to amplitude.

The slider of the audio player was made of [roundSlider](https://github.com/soundar24/roundSlider)
